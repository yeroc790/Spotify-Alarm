# Spotify-Alarm
Spotify Alarm clock script using node js

<p>This application is a pet project of mine and may or may not continue to get developed</p>

<h3>Node JS</h3>
<p>It was developed using Node JS on a Windows machine, and it might not have support on other OS's. Node JS is an adaptation of Javascript to be used on a console instead of a web browser. It is essential to have Node JS and NPM installed to run this application. See information below on how to download</p>

<h3>Please note</h3>
<p>If you are using Windows, this application requires that SpotifyWebHelper.exe is running, to enable this, make sure that
in Spotify Settings, you have "Allow Spotify to be opened from the web" enabled</p>
