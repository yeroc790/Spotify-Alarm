# Spotify-Alarm
Spotify Alarm clock script using node js

<p>This application is a pet project of mine and may or may not continue to get developed</p>

<p>It was developed using Node JS on a Windows machine, and it might not have support on other OS's</p>

<h3>Please note</h3>
<p>This application requires that SpotifyWebHelper.exe is running, to enable this, make sure that
in Spotify Settings, you have "Allow Spotify to be opened from the web" enabled</p>
